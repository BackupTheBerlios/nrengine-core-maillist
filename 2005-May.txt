Subject: [Nrengine-core] Clock/Timer System
Message-ID: <200505010046.28070.stud_info2@yahoo.de>

News about nrEngine!


nrEngine now supports a clock/timer system (tutorial was found in Game 
Programming Gems 4).
 nrEngine has now one internal clock which always run in the same speed. It 
can get data from external time source. This can be either platform ticks, 
user input, file or something else. So you can let run your animations in the 
same speed as in videos/Zwischensequenzen. It allows also something like 
synchronizing.
 There are also timers, which can run at different speed. So you can use more 
than one timer for your application. e.g. one timer with normal speed for GUI 
and one for the game. The game's one can be paused, so the game should be 
paused too, but the GUI is still accessible.
 You can also create something like Matrix/MaxPayne2-Effects, where time can 
go slower than the worlds time.

This you can find on the CVS-Version. The release file will be updated if this 
timer system is extensively tested.
I will also tell you something about timing systems in games on Monday in the 
Seminar.

bye,
 Art

Hi, folks!

I have some slides which can help you by developing of your games. This slides 
are from the "Algorithmen f?r Computerspiele Seminar" given in Sommersemster 
2003 on the University of Stuttgard. The students there did not made any game 
but gave talks about it. So you will possibly find some usefull information 
on that slides.

The slides you can find here on my page:
